# Project Overview
Analyzed AWS SaaS data to boost sales by identifying products that respond differently to discounts across countries. Developed targeted strategies, increasing sales by offering discounts only to price-sensitive products while reducing them for insensitive ones.

**AWS BACKGROUND**
---
Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the cloud computing arm of Amazon.com, the global e-commerce giant. Launched in 2006, AWS has grown to become the dominant force in cloud computing, serving millions of customers worldwide, from startups to Fortune 500 companies.

At its core, AWS offers a vast array of cloud-based services, including computing power, storage solutions, databases, machine learning tools, and more. These services enable businesses to offload their IT infrastructure and operations to the cloud, eliminating the need for costly hardware investments and reducing the complexity of managing data centers.

AWS operates on a pay-as-you-go pricing model, allowing businesses to scale their resources up or down based on demand, and pay only for the services they use. This flexibility is particularly attractive to businesses with fluctuating workloads or those looking to rapidly scale their operations.

One of the key benefits of AWS is its global infrastructure. With data centers located in regions around the world, AWS enables businesses to deploy their applications closer to their customers, reducing latency and improving performance.

AWS has become the go-to choice for businesses looking to innovate and accelerate their digital transformation initiatives. From startups launching their first app to large enterprises migrating their entire IT infrastructure to the cloud, AWS provides the tools and resources needed to drive business growth and agility in today's competitive marketplace.

In addition to its technical capabilities, AWS also offers a rich ecosystem of partners and resources to support businesses on their cloud journey. From training and certification programs to a vibrant marketplace of third-party solutions, AWS provides businesses with the tools and support they need to succeed in the cloud.

As the leading player in the cloud computing market, AWS continues to innovate and expand its offerings, driving forward the future of technology and empowering businesses to achieve their goals in the digital age.

**Opening**
---
My data exploration strategy begins with data cleaning and anomaly detection to transform raw data into an accurate, consistent, and analysis-ready format by identifying and correcting errors, handling missing data, standardizing formats, removing duplicates, and validating data integrity. Following this, I will conduct detailed data analysis aligned with business objectives, encompassing analyses to derive actionable insights and support informed decision-making, ultimately driving strategic business planning.

**OBJECTIVE:**
---
How can we develop data-driven discount optimization strategies to maximize sales and market competitiveness across our product portfolio?

1. What is the correlation between discount levels and quantity sold for each product?
2. Can we identify products that demonstrate a significant response to discounts compared to others?
3. What patterns emerge when comparing the impact of discounts on sensitive and insensitive products over time?
4. Can we identify specific regions where certain products are particularly sensitive or insensitive to discounts?
5. What approaches can be implemented to optimize sensitive product discounts or reduce insensitive product discounts to maintain competitiveness?

**PROBLEM SCOPE:**
---
- The dataset under consideration spans the timeframe from 2020 to 2023.
- The analysis primarily focuses on Sales, Quantity, and Discount data, with minimal exploration of profitability due to limited information.
- Insights and prescriptive analysis will not involve machine learning techniques, as they are beyond the scope of this learning context.

**Conclusion:**
---
We have a strong assumption that the ContactMatcher product is highly sensitive to discounts. Therefore, from a business perspective, we need to maintain the use of discounts but in the right intervals and amounts. While discounts can boost sales, they can also pose a risk to profitability. Hence, the company's discount policy needs careful consideration.

On the other hand, for the OneView product, we could consider reducing the use of discounts. It's evident that OneView is not sensitive to discounts, indicating that it has its own market segment and unique selling points. Even without discounts, customers still subscribe to the product. What we need here is optimization of campaigns or similar strategies.
